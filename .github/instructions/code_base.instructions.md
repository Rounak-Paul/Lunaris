c++ without modern features, no comments in code, do not put not implemented code, class names PascalCase, function names snake_case, variables in snake_case, private variables _snake_case, performance first, cpu cache hit first, no smart pointers, where needed, follow the existing code style, no legacy compatibility, all refactors must be complete and through, no partial implementations, no duplicate logic, code should not look like AI generated. Keep code modular, maintainable with clear separation of concerns and future proof.
